# dl_quotes

#-## This project contains various scripts written to download quotes from various sources that are importable into GNUCash and/or Quicken 2017. For Quicken, it has been tested with 2017 version but it is likely to work for all version from 2014 and onward as they all use same format for importing in prices via CSV import.

Currently following two sets of buckets are supported:

US Securities from Yahoo Finance (yahoo_finance directory)
US Gov't Trift Savings Plan -- aka TSP (TSP directory)
Updated YAhoo JSON module for Finance::Quote to fetch cookies and crumb (FinanceQuote directory)

```
